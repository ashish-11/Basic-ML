## Overview

In this repository, you will find detailed Jupyter Notebooks that cover the following machine learning algorithms:
- **K-means Clustering**
- **DBSCAN Clustering**

Each notebook is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing us to understand and implement these algorithms from the ground up.

## Notebooks

### ðŸ§® Clustering Algorithms
1. [**K-means Clustering**](notebooks/k-means.ipynb)
2. [**DBSCAN Clustering**](notebooks/dbscan.ipynb)

## Usage

To explore and run the notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Basic-ML-Notebooks.git
    cd Basic-ML-Notebooks
    ```

2. **Setup your environment:**
    Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it using:
    ```sh
    pip install jupyter
    ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   This will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

4. **Navigate to the notebooks:**
    - Open the `notebooks` directory and choose the notebook you want to explore.
